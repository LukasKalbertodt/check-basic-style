# GitHub Action to check basic file properties

Small action to make sure all files satisfy very basic properties:

- All files are UTF-8
- All files have a single trailing newline
- Lines have no trailing whitespace
- Lines are not longer than a limit
- `\n` line endings are used (no `\r`)
- No tab characters `\t` used


**Note**:
This is an action tailored to my needs and I specifically developed this for use in my own projects.
If this is useful to you: great!
But I likely won't accept PRs with features that are not useful to me personally.
